# backbonetest

This is an application that amalgamates some of the functionality found in 
[odoe]'s bbdemo and MapStyler applications here on github.

I'm using it as a basepoint to learn how backbone, esri [ArcGIS JavaScript] api and 
js build processes work.

This introduces editing work flow in a left panel.
Am testing out forking for a mobile layout
